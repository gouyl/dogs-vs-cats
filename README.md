## Project: Capstone Proposal and Capstone Project

**Note**

### Introduction 

Our goal is to build a machine learning algorithm capable of detecting the correct animal (cat or dog) in new unseen images. So we are trying to solve a classification problem. 
In this project, I have write an algorithm to classify whether images contain either a dog or a cat. 
Our algorithm has images as input and return whether image contains dogs or cats.
In this Capstone, we have resolved a project from kaggle competition and using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats).
In this project we have applied Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to predict whether images contains dogs or cats. CNN is used here because CNN are widely used for images classification task.





### Install

This project requires Python 2.7 and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- OpenCv
- scikit-learn
- Keras 
- Tensorflow
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook. In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory capstone-project/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:
`jupyter notebook boston_housing.ipynb`

You will need to first download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data.

Enjoy.
